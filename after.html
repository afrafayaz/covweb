    Tips to follow after vaccination: Here are some valuable tips that will help you after vaccination:
    <ul>
        <li> After vaccination, stay seated at the vaccination centre for 15-30 minutes. Health workers will monitor you for immediate reactions. Report if you feel dizzy or have nausea, vomiting, or any allergic reaction. Drink plenty of fluids and keep your
            body hydrated after the vaccine dose. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Avoid consuming alcohol or smoking. Soothe your arm. You may place a cool or wet washcloth on the area. </li><br>
        <li> Swing yourvaccinated arm to calm the inflammation. Be prepared for some minor side effects as your body builds immune protection. These may go away in 1-2 days. The side effects are: Pain and redness at the site of injection Chills and mild fever
            Headache Fatigue and body ache Joint and muscle pain Take paracetamol if you have any of the above symptoms. </li><br>
        <li> If they last for more than a week, contact your doctor immediately. Wear light clothes. </li><br>
        <li> Download your vaccination certificate, mark your calendar for the second dose of the vaccine, and schedule an appointment. </li><br>
        <li> After the second dose of the vaccine, you may experience similar symptoms seen after the first dose. If the side effects persist for more than 1-2 days, call your doctor. Remember that the antibodies that develop after the second dose of the vaccine
            reach a protective level after 15 days. </li><br>
        <li> Hence, be careful; do not relax the preventive measures. If you wish to take any other vaccine for a different medical condition, maintain a gap of at least 14 days after taking the Covid-19 vaccine. </li><br>
        <li> It is also important to discuss with your doctor if you have been on immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate. Your doctor might put the medication on hold for two weeks after the Covid-19 vaccine.</li><br>
