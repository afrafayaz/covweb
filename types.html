        <h1> COVID-19 : ORIGIN AND HISTORY</h1>


</head>

<body>
    <h2>WHAT IS CORONAVIRUS?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</li><br>
        <li> Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</li><br>
        <li>Coronavirus Disease is named by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11th February, 2020 as "COVID-19". The World Health Organisation declared a global emergency on 30th January, 2020. COVID-19 disease is caused by a Coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
            This type of Coronavirus has not been seen before, therefore it is also known as Novel(New) Coronavirus.</li><br>
        <li> A person can get affected by COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. It is predominantly a respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID-19 may experience a wide range of symptoms from mild to severe
            categories. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle or body aches; headache; loss of taste or smell of recent onset; sore throat; congestion
            or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; diarrhea.</li><br>
        <li>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
            chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</li><br>
        <li> The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently
            and not touching your face.</li><br>
        <li> The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important to practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>ORIGIN OF SARS-CoV-2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses, several of which cause respiratory diseases in humans, from the common cold to more rare and serious diseases such as
            the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), both of which have high mortality rates and were detected for the first time in 2003 and 2012, respectively.
        </li><br>
        <li>CoVs are divided into four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-CoV. All CoVs currently known to cause disease in humans belong to the alpha- or the beta-CoV. Many of these CoVs can infect several animal species as well. SARS-CoV infected civet
            cats and infected humans in 2002 and MERS-CoV is found in dromedary camels and infected humans in 2012.</li><br>
        <li>A virus that is regularly transmitted from an animal to a human is called a zoonotic virus. When a virus passes from animals to humans for the first time it is called a spillover event. When a new virus is discovered, it is important to understand
            where it comes from. This is critical to be able to identify and isolate the source and prevent further introductions of the virus into the human population. Viruses that are genetically closely linked tend to come from a similar source or
            similar geographic area.</li><br>
        <li>SARS is an airborne virus and can spread through small droplets of saliva in a similar way to the cold and influenza. It was the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century and showed a clear capacity to spread
            along the routes of international air travel. SARS can also be spread indirectly via surfaces that have been touched by someone who is infected with the virus.</li><br>
        <li>Most patients identified with SARS were previously healthy adults aged 25–70 years. A few suspected cases of SARS have been reported among children under 15 years. The case fatality among persons with illness meeting the current WHO case definition
            for probable and suspected cases of SARS is around 3%.</li><br>

        <li>SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, belongs to a group of genetically related viruses that includes SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bat populations. Currently, the zoonotic source of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.</li><br>

        <li>The first human cases of COVID-19, the coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, were first reported from Wuhan City, China, in December 2019.</li><br></ul>

    <h2>Could the novel coronavirus be man-made in a laboratory?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The world woke up to an unknown pneumonia-like illness caused by a viral outbreak in China at the end of December 2019. On December 30, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued an “urgent notice” saying that cases of pneumonia had emerged
            from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in this Chinese city. China informed WHO about the outbreak on December 31 & the seafood market was designated as the epicentre. By the end of the first week of January 2020, some activists, particularly
            in Hong Kong, were speaking about the SARS-2 emerging from a Chinese lab claiming that it was a Bio-Weapon. Author Fang Fang, a popular Chinese writer, blamed the authorities in Wuhan for deliberately holding back information that Covid-19
            was a human-to-human spread.</li><br>
        <li>Soon, reports in the UK and the US claimed that SARS-CoV-2 could have escaped from China’s Wuhan lab. Some intelligence source-based reports said China had been working on a Bio-Weapon, and that a panel of experts had expressed its dissatisfaction
            with the biosafety level of the Wuhan lab.</li><br>
        <li>On February 9 this year, the WHO said its panel that visited China to investigate the origin of Covid-19 did not find evidence to support “the laboratory incident hypothesis” and it “is extremely unlikely to explain introduction of the virus into
            the human population”. However, two days later, WHO Secretary General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus took a sort of about-turn to say “that all hypotheses remain open and require further study”.</li><br>
        <li>Three researchers from China's Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) sought hospital care in November 2019, months before China disclosed the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing a previously undisclosed US intelligence
            report.
        </li><br>
        <li>A recent study reportedly claimed that the Chinese scientists also tried to cover their tracks by reverse-engineering the viruses which have no ‘credible natural ancestor’ and to make it look like they naturally arose from bats. China refused
            to give raw data on early COVID-19 cases to the WHO-led team probing the origins of the pandemic, according to one of the team’s investigators, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the outbreak began. And it's not just politicians.
            Many scientists and researchers agree that the lab theory must be investigated.</li><br>
        <li>In January last year, Indian scientists from Kusuma School of Biological Sciences in IIT Delhi had published a paper, where they had found that the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 had four ‘unnatural insertions’ in its genome which are not
            found in any other Coronavirus, and the insertions are similar to those found in HIV virus. The study had raised the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have been bioengineered using the existing Coronavirus and HIV virus, and were forced to withdraw
            study because of international pressure.</li><br>
        <li>US President Joe Biden’s NSA Jake Sullivan prepared a detailed report about the coronavirus origin in March. He said that there were two conflicting elements in the report, one leaning towards the virus spreading from an animal contact with a
            human and the other that it leaked out of the Wuhan lab in China.</li><br> </ul>
    <h2>LAST GLOBAL PANDEMIC</h2>
    <ul>
        2009 H1N1 Pandemic (H1N1pdm09 virus)<br><br>
        <li>10 years ago, an influenza (flu) virus emerged that had never been seen before in humans. This novel H1N1 flu virus was first detected in April of 2009 in the United States, and spread quickly around the world. On June 11 th , 2009, the World
            Health Organization declared the start of the first flu pandemic in 40 years. CDC estimates that between 151,700 and 575,400 people died worldwide from the 2009 H1N1 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated. That H1N1 virus
            has continued to circulate worldwide annually since it emerged in 2009.</li><br>
        <li>The 10-year commemoration of the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic is an opportunity to reflect on that event in history as well as to acknowledge the importance of ongoing efforts to improve domestic and global capacity to detect and respond to novel flu
            viruses. Since 2009, substantial advances have been made in influenza science and preparedness.</li><br></ul>
