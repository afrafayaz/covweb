                The COVID-19 vaccines produce protection against the disease, as a result of developing an immune response to the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Developing immunity through vaccination means there is a reduced risk of developing the illness and its consequences. This
                immunity helps you fight the virus if exposed. Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, because if you are protected from getting infected and from disease, you are less likely to infect someone else. This is particularly
                important to protect people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as healthcare providers, older or elderly adults, and people with other medical conditions.</li><br>
            <li>
                The reason vaccines substantially retain protection against disease is likely related to the broad immune response they induce, which means that virus changes or mutations are unlikely to make vaccines completely ineffective. If any of these vaccines
                become less effective against one or more variants, it will likely be possible to change the composition of the vaccines to protect against these variants, however this will take time and additional data to fully evaluate. Data continues
                to be collected and analysed on new variants of the COVID-19 virus. WHO will update its guidance when more details are known about the impact of specific variants on specific vaccines. WHO’s SAGE is reviewing this evidence on a regular
                basis.

                Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can keep you from contracting the disease by creating an antibody response in your body without your having to become infected with the novel coronavirus.</li><br>
            <li>
                COVID-19 vaccination might also prevent you from getting COVID-19, or, if you contract the virus, the vaccine might prevent you from becoming seriously ill or from developing serious complications. There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you,
                although the disease can cause severe complications and lead to death in some people.</li><br>
            <li>A COVID-19 vaccine might also help protect people around you from the disease - especially those at increased risk of severe illness from the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.</li><br>
            <li>The combination of getting vaccinated and strictly adhering to the COVID-19 safety guidelines, including wearing a mask, washing hands frequently and social distancing, will offer the best protection from the dreaded virus.</li><br>

            <li>COVID-19 vaccines are safe COVID-19 vaccines were developed using science that has been around for decades. COVID-19 vaccines are not experimental. They went through all the required stages of clinical trials. Extensive testing and monitoring
                have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective.</li><br>
            <li>Once you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing more After you are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, you can resume many activities that you did before the pandemic. You can resume activities without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart,
                except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance</li><br>
            <li>COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection Get vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID-19,.
                Learn more about the clinical considerations for people were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, or history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children (MIS-A or MIS-C). COVID-19 is still
                a threat to people who are unvaccinated. Some people who get COVID-19 can become severely ill, which could result in hospitalization, and some people have ongoing health problems several weeks or even longer after getting infected. Even
                people who did not have symptoms when they were infected can have these ongoing health problems.</li><br>
            <li>Immunity after COVID-19 vaccination There is still a lot we are learning about COVID-19 vaccines and CDC is constantly reviewing evidence and updating guidance. We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated. What we
                do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer choice. At this time, there
                are limited data on vaccine effectiveness in people who are immunocompromised, including those taking immunosuppressive medications. Learn more about the considerations for fully vaccinated people who are immunocompromised.</li><br></ul>
